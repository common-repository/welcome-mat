Welcome Mat PRO

== Description ==
[WordPress Welcome Mat](https://welcomemat.io/) creates your highest converting pages for email list building or other offerings. We found it is one of the most effective ways to build your site's audience.  We use a Welcome Mat on a number of our sites and have found it to be the most effective tool we have.

Our Welcome Mat plugin runs completely on your site without connecting to outside services.  This is important so that you never lose  email from your visitors or your conversion metrics. Plus it is easier to have all your information available in your WordPress admin panel.
